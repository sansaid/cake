## How gRPC code was created for caked

* Followed instructions in [prerequisites](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/#prerequisites)
    * For Windows, placed the `protoc` binary in the `%SystemRoot%` path
* Created a `caked.proto` file in the root of `./caked/` directory
* Ran the following command in the root of the `./caked/` directory:
```sh
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative .\caked.proto
```
