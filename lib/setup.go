// Setup - where the subcommands for `cake` are setup. To create a new subcommand, create a new file in the
// `cmds` directory with the same name as the subcommand and define a function called `setupExampleCmd`, where
// `Example` is the subcommand name. Call the function here once done. See `start.go` as an example.
// func Setup() {
